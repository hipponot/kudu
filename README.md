Kudu
=====

## Introduction
Kudu is a Vagrant based developer virtualization platform. In its current state Kudu supports the development of Sinatra Web APIs and ruby gems.  The host OS can be either ubuntu or OSX the guest OS is ubuntu.  The system includes build-ware for packaging ruby projects as gems that is optimzied for fast developer iterations and supports transitive dependency management.  The build-ware is extensible, adding support for other language types is WIP.

## Prerequisites

Your system must have ruby >1.87 installed.  

## Install VirtualBox

**OSX**<br>
[Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install VirtualBox for OSX.  Double click the dmg file and follow the instructions

**Ubuntu**<br>
Virtual box can be installed via apt by following the instructions [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

## Install Vagrant
[Download](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.0.6) the Vagrant package appropriate to your system

**OSX**<br>
Double click the dmg file and follow the instructions

**Ubuntu**<br>

``` 
sudo dpkg -i vagrant_i686.deb
```
Add **/opt/vagrant/bin** to your path

## Install vagrant-vbguest
This takes some of the pain out of VirutalBox guest additions between guest and host
```
vagrant gem install vagrant-vbguest
```
## Initialize the Guest OS

``` 
cd kudu/vagrant
vagrant up
``` 
The first time this command is run the the Vagrant vbox image will be pulled down from the source URI contained in the VagrantFile (this can take some time).  Upon boot up the unadorned image is is provisioned via chef-solo. The default setup is RVM, ruby and the gemset necessary to run the Kudu build system as well as some common shell & editor setup. 
Upon completion of the up command the newly provision VM can be accessed via the below.

```
vagrant ssh -- -X
```
You can read about other useful vagrant commands via the below.

```
vagrant -h
```

## Login in and kick the tires

```
vagrant ssh -- -X
vagrant-> cd Kudu/example
vagrant-> kudu create-project -n kudu_example_sinatra  -t sinatra
vagrant-> cd kutu_test_sinatra
vagrant-> kudu build
vagrant-> kudu service-start
```

## What did I just do ?
Kudu generated and built a simple sinatra based web api.  The source is located in 'kudu_example_sinatra/lib/kudu_example_sinatra.rb'. Test your new api by hitting URIs below in a web browser on your *host* OS.

```
http://localhost:9393
http://localhost:9393/hello
```
